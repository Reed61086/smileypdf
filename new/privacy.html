            <p><strong>Last Updated: [**INSERT DATE** - e.g., October 26, 2023]</strong></p>

            <p>Welcome to SmileyPDF.com ("SmileyPDF", "we", "us", or "our"). We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users ("user", "you", or "your"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our website SmileyPDF.com (the "Site") and use our online PDF tools (the "Services"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the site or use the services.</p>

            <p>**IMPORTANT NOTE FOR USERS:** Your privacy, especially concerning the documents you upload, is paramount to us. We have designed our systems with this principle in mind.</p>

            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect on the Site includes:</p>

            <h3>a) Uploaded Files</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>File Content:</strong> When you upload files to use our Services (e.g., merge, split, compress PDFs), the content of those files is processed by our servers solely to perform the requested operation.</li>
                <li><strong>File Metadata:</strong> We may process metadata associated with your files (e.g., filename, file size, file type) to facilitate the Service.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Crucially: We do NOT store your uploaded files permanently. All uploaded files and any generated output files are automatically and permanently deleted from our servers after a short retention period, typically one (1) hour after processing is complete or the download link is generated. We do not view, copy, or analyze the content of your files beyond the automated processing required for the tool's function.</strong></p>

             <h3>b) Usage Data</h3>
             <p>When you access the Site and use our Services, we may automatically collect certain information about your device and usage patterns. This may include:</p>

                <li>Browser type and version</li>

                <li>Error logs (if technical issues occur during processing)</li>
            </ul>
             <p>This data is generally aggregated and anonymized and is used for website analytics, improving our Services, monitoring performance, and diagnosing technical problems.</p>

                         <li>**Advertising Cookies:** [**IF USING ADSENSE/OTHER AD NETWORKS, ADD THIS**] Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to your website or other websites. Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ads Settings</a>. (Alternatively, users can opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies for personalized advertising by visiting <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>).</li>
                     </ul>

We use this information solely to respond to your inquiries and provide support.</p>

            <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the information we collect primarily to provide, maintain, and improve our Services. Specifically, we may use your information to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Operate and maintain the Site and Services.</li>
                <li>Process your uploaded files to perform the requested PDF manipulations.</li>

                <li>Prevent fraudulent activity and ensure the security of our Site and systems.</li>
                <li>Comply with legal obligations.</li>
                <li>[**IF USING ADSENSE**] Display advertisements (potentially personalized based on cookies, as described above).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>We reiterate that we do not use the content of your uploaded files for any purpose other than providing the requested Service, and they are deleted shortly after processing.</strong></p>

            <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
            <p>We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share your personal information or file content with third parties for their marketing purposes.</p>
            <p>We may share information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share technical or usage data (not file content) with third-party vendors and service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as website hosting, data analysis, error tracking, and IT services. These providers are obligated to protect your information and use it only for the services they provide to us.</li>
                <li><strong>Advertising Partners:</strong> [**IF USING ADSENSE/OTHER AD NETWORKS**] We may share data collected via cookies with third-party advertising partners (like Google AdSense) to facilitate the display of advertisements on our Site. This does not include the content of your uploaded files. Please refer to the partners' privacy policies for more information on their data practices.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of SmileyPDF, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.</li>
                <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, as permitted by law and/or contract.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
            <p>We implement administrative, technical, and physical security measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We use secure protocols (HTTPS) for data transmission. However, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against interception or misuse. Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security if you provide information.</p>
            <p>The most significant security measure for your document content is our policy of **automatic deletion** of files after a short period (typically 1 hour).</p>

            <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>As stated previously, uploaded files and their processed derivatives are automatically deleted from our servers typically within one (1) hour after processing. We may retain anonymized or aggregated usage data for longer periods for analytical purposes. Contact information provided via support requests may be retained as necessary to resolve the inquiry and for record-keeping purposes.</p>

            <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Our Site and Services are not intended for use by children under the age of 13 [**Adjust age if necessary based on local regulations, e.g., 16 in GDPR regions**]. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>

            <h2>7. Your Data Protection Rights [**Consider adding specifics based on GDPR/CCPA if applicable**]</h2>
            <p>Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, such as the right to access, correct, or delete your data, or to object to certain processing activities. Given the nature of our service (automatic deletion of core data), exercising these rights primarily relates to usage data or contact information. Please contact us using the details below if you wish to inquire about these rights.</p>
            <p>[**Optional but recommended for CCPA/GDPR:** Add specific sections detailing rights under those regulations if you expect significant traffic from California or the EU.]</p>

            <h2>8. Third-Party Websites</h2>
            <p>The Site may contain links to third-party websites (e.g., advertisers, affiliates). We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these third-party sites. We encourage you to read their privacy policies before providing any information.</p>

            <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
