            <p><strong>Last Updated: [**INSERT DATE** - e.g., October 26, 2023]</strong></p>

            <p>Welcome to SmileyPDF.com ("SmileyPDF", "we", "us", or "our"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the SmileyPDF.com website (the "Site") and the online PDF tools and services offered thereon (collectively, the "Services").</p>
            <p>By accessing the Site or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not access the Site or use the Services.</p>

            <h2>1. Description of Services</h2>
            <p>SmileyPDF provides a collection of free online tools designed for manipulating Portable Document Format (PDF) files, including but not limited to merging, splitting, compressing, converting, editing, rotating, unlocking, protecting, and watermarking PDFs. The Services are provided electronically via the Site.</p>

            <h2>2. Use of Services</h2>
            <h3>a) Eligibility</h3>
            <p>You must be at least 13 years old [**Adjust age if necessary based on local regulations, e.g., 16 in GDPR regions**] to use the Services. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement.</p>

            <h3>b) Acceptable Use</h3>
            <p>You agree to use the Services only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You agree not to use the Services:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In any way that violates any applicable federal, state, local, or international law or regulation.</li>
                <li>To process files that you do not have the legal right to use, modify, or possess. This includes copyrighted material for which you do not hold the rights or necessary permissions, or documents containing illegal or harmful content.</li>
                <li>To process files protected by passwords or other security measures that you do not have the legitimate authority to bypass (e.g., using the "Unlock PDF" tool on files you do not own or have permission to decrypt).</li>
                <li>To engage in any conduct that restricts or inhibits anyone's use or enjoyment of the Services, or which, as determined by us, may harm SmileyPDF or users of the Services or expose them to liability.</li>
                <li>To attempt to gain unauthorized access to, interfere with, damage, or disrupt any parts of the Site, the server on which the Site is stored, or any server, computer, or database connected to the Services.</li>
                <li>To introduce any viruses, trojan horses, worms, logic bombs, or other material which is malicious or technologically harmful.</li>
                <li>To use any robot, spider, or other automatic device, process, or means to access the Services for any purpose, including monitoring or copying any of the material on the Site, without our prior written consent (standard search engine indexing is generally permitted).</li>
                <li>Otherwise attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Services.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>c) File Handling and Responsibility</h3>
